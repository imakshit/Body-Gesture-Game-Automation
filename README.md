# Body-Gesture-Game-Automation
**Game automation using computer vision**

## About The Project

In this project, we are going to write a python script to enable gesture control over gameplay.

You can play any game with gesture control by making minor changes to the code.


## Pre-requisites

1. Knowledge of Python

2. Knowledge of OpenCv

3. Knowledge of Face Detection using OpenCv

## Packages Required

1. OpenCV

2. Pynput


## How to run the project

1. Clone or download the repository

2. Install the required packages

3. Open the game you want to play

## What next?

Based on this idea, you can make many cool projects like -

1. Game automation with hand recognition

2. Controlling music player with gesture 

3. Flashing a warning if a person is too close to the screen

4. Play/pause video when the person is looking away from screen

5. Play on-screen instruments using gesture
